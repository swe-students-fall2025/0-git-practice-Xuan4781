# Software Website

[dev.to]
I found this website that features content (posts, guides, tutorials, discussion threads) about programming. I believe it's a community mainly for software developers. I like how it lets socialing become a form of learning just like how people use Reddit for not just communication but also a chance to ask questions. This website is pretty much a good resource for both beginners and experienced programmers. It's also interesting how it's not just limited to software but also just career advice, and new tech.

YI-KAI HUANG(Daniel): That seems like a pretty solid website!
dev.to has a super casual vibe, which makes it feel way less intimidating 
compared to some other tech forums. I¡¯m kinda surprised by how many different
sections you can find there¡ªpeople share everything including just random thoughts about coding life.
Pretty cool spot  if you wanna pick up tips or just see what other folks are building.
