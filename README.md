# Software Website

[dev.to]
I found this website that features content (posts, guides, tutorials, discussion threads) about programming. I believe it's a community mainly for software developers. I like how it lets socialing become a form of learning just like how people use Reddit for not just communication but also a chance to ask questions. This website is pretty much a good resource for both beginners and experienced programmers. It's also interesting how it's not just limited to software but also just career advice, and new tech.
